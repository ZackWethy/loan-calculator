          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">How Student Loan Interest Works</h2>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">1. Interest Accrual</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li>Interest begins accruing from the day your loan is disbursed</li>
            <li>For unsubsidized loans, interest accumulates even while you're in school</li>
            <li>Subsidized loans don't accrue interest while you're in school or during deferment periods</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">2. Capitalization</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li>Interest may capitalize, meaning it's added to your principal balance</li>
            <li>Capitalization typically occurs after periods of deferment or forbearance</li>
            <li>This can significantly increase the total amount you owe</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">3. Interest Rate Types</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li>Fixed rates remain the same for the life of the loan</li>
            <li>Variable rates can change based on market conditions</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-12">
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Calculating Student Loan Interest</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Student loan interest is typically calculated using a simple daily interest formula:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6">
            <li>Calculate the daily interest rate (annual rate ÷ 365)</li>
            <li>Multiply the daily rate by your current principal balance</li>
            <li>Multiply that amount by the number of days since your last payment</li>
          </ol>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">Example Calculation</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">Let's say you have a $10,000 loan with a 5% annual interest rate:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6">
            <li>Daily interest rate: 5% ÷ 365 = 0.0137%</li>
            <li>Daily interest charge: $10,000 × 0.0137% = $1.37</li>
            <li>Monthly interest (assuming a 30-day month): $1.37 × 30 = $41.10</li>
          </ol>

        <section className="mb-12">
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Strategies to Minimize Student Loan Interest</h2>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">1. Make Interest Payments While in School</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">Paying interest on unsubsidized loans during school can prevent it from capitalizing. Even small payments can make a big difference over time.</p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">2. Choose a Shorter Repayment Term</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">A shorter term means less time for interest to accrue, though monthly payments will be higher. This strategy can save you thousands in interest over the life of the loan.</p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">3. Pay More Than the Minimum</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">Whenever possible, pay more than the minimum required payment. Extra payments go directly towards reducing your principal balance, which in turn reduces the amount of interest that accrues.</p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">4. Refinance for a Lower Interest Rate</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">If you have a good credit score and stable income, you may be able to refinance your loans for a lower interest rate. Be cautious when refinancing federal loans, as you may lose certain benefits.</p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">5. Set Up Autopay</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">Many lenders offer a small interest rate reduction (often 0.25%) for setting up automatic payments. This not only saves you money but also ensures you never miss a payment.</p>
