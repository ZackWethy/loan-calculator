          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Understanding Debt Repayment Strategies</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Before we compare the Snowball and Avalanche methods, it's crucial to understand why having a strategy is important:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li>Helps you stay organized and focused</li>
            <li>Potentially saves money on interest</li>
            <li>Provides a clear path to becoming debt-free</li>
            <li>Motivates you to stick to your repayment plan</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-12">
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">The Debt Snowball Method</h2>
          
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">How It Works</h3>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>List all your debts from smallest balance to largest</li>
            <li>Make minimum payments on all debts</li>
            <li>Put any extra money towards the smallest debt</li>
            <li>Once the smallest debt is paid off, roll that payment into the next smallest debt</li>
          </ol>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">Pros of the Snowball Method</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>Quick wins provide psychological motivation</li>
            <li>Simplifies your debt by eliminating individual loans faster</li>
            <li>Can improve cash flow as you eliminate monthly payments</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">Cons of the Snowball Method</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>May pay more in interest over time</li>
            <li>Doesn't always address high-interest debt first</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">When to Use the Snowball Method</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>If you need motivation to stick with your debt repayment plan</li>
            <li>When you have several small debts you can pay off quickly</li>
            <li>If the interest rates on your loans are similar</li>
          </ul>

        <section className="mb-12">
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">The Debt Avalanche Method</h2>
          
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">How It Works</h3>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>List all your debts from highest interest rate to lowest</li>
            <li>Make minimum payments on all debts</li>
            <li>Put any extra money towards the highest-interest debt</li>
            <li>Once the highest-interest debt is paid off, move to the next highest</li>
          </ol>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">Pros of the Avalanche Method</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>Saves more money on interest over time</li>
            <li>Mathematically the most efficient way to pay off debt</li>
            <li>Addresses costly high-interest debt first</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">Cons of the Avalanche Method</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>May take longer to see tangible progress</li>
            <li>Can be demotivating if high-interest debts have large balances</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">When to Use the Avalanche Method</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>If you're motivated by long-term savings</li>
            <li>When you have high-interest debts that are significantly costlier than others</li>
            <li>If you have the discipline to stick with the plan despite slower visible progress</li>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Snowball vs. Avalanche: A Practical Comparison</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Let's look at a hypothetical scenario to illustrate the difference:</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Suppose you have the following debts:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>Credit Card A: $1,000 balance at 20% APR</li>
            <li>Student Loan: $10,000 balance at 5% APR</li>
            <li>Credit Card B: $3,000 balance at 18% APR</li>
            <li>Personal Loan: $5,000 balance at 10% APR</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mb-4">Assuming you can pay $500 extra per month beyond minimum payments:</p>
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">Snowball Method Order:</h3>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>Credit Card A</li>
            <li>Credit Card B</li>
            <li>Personal Loan</li>
            <li>Student Loan</li>
          </ol>
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">Avalanche Method Order:</h3>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>Credit Card A</li>
            <li>Credit Card B</li>
            <li>Personal Loan</li>
            <li>Student Loan</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mb-4">In this case, the order is the same, but the Avalanche method would save more in interest over time.</p>
