          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6">
            <li><strong>Calculate Discretionary Income</strong>: Your payment is based on the difference between your income and 150% of the poverty guideline for your family size and state.</li>
            <li><strong>Determine Payment Amount</strong>: Depending on the plan, you'll pay 10-20% of your discretionary income.</li>
            <li><strong>Annual Recertification</strong>: You must recertify your income and family size each year.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Changes</strong>: Your payment may change annually based on your updated information.</li>
            <li><strong>Loan Forgiveness</strong>: Any remaining balance is forgiven after 20-25 years of payments, depending on the plan.</li>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Income-driven repayment plans can be a valuable tool for managing federal student loan debt, especially for those with high debt-to-income ratios. By understanding how these plans work and carefully considering your financial situation and goals, you can make an informed decision about whether an IDR plan is right for you.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Remember, while IDR plans can provide short-term relief, it's important to consider the long-term implications, including total interest paid and the potential tax impact of loan forgiveness. Always consult with a financial advisor or your loan servicer to discuss your specific situation and options.
