          <p className="mb-4">
            Choosing the right repayment strategy for your student loans can save you money and help you become debt-free faster. Two popular methods are the avalanche and snowball strategies. Let's explore these options and help you determine which might work best for you.
          </p>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Avalanche Method</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The avalanche method focuses on paying off loans with the highest interest rates first. This strategy can save you more money in interest over time.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">How it works:</h3>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>Make minimum payments on all loans</li>
            <li>Put any extra money towards the loan with the highest interest rate</li>
            <li>Once the highest-interest loan is paid off, move to the next highest</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Saves the most money in interest over time<br />
            <strong>Cons:</strong> May take longer to see progress if high-interest loans have large balances
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Snowball Method</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The snowball method involves paying off the smallest loan balances first. This strategy can provide psychological wins and motivation as you pay off loans quickly.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">How it works:</h3>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">

          </ol>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Provides quick wins and motivation<br />
            <strong>Cons:</strong> May pay more in interest over time compared to the avalanche method

          <p className="mb-4">
            The best repayment strategy depends on your financial situation and personal preferences. Consider these factors:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>Your loan balances and interest rates</li>

            <li>Your motivation and need for quick wins</li>
            <li>Your long-term financial goals</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Remember, you can always adjust your strategy as your situation changes. The most important thing is to stay consistent with your payments and keep working towards becoming debt-free.
